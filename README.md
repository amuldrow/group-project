# Park & Brews 

## Description 

The Parks & Brews application conveniently connects National Park lovers to the closest breweries based on the National Park location along with providing information about the National parks and breweries. Once the viewer clicks on the national park URL they will be presented with a search bar that has a list of the 50 states once a state is selected they will be provided with a list of the National parks in that state. Once a National park is selected information about that National patk will show up below and a link to the parks website to see more information. A map will also be shown to the right with markers of breweries nearby when a marker is selected information about the brewery is shown. All breweries are saved to local storage and show up when the user revisits the site under recent searches.
